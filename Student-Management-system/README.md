### Project Overview

 **Student Management System**
    :::  It tells how we can  handle different  management problems  while evaluating tests or we can even calculate the outcome of the work done by different 
         people. (for begineers)


### Learnings from the project

 1:Data Wrangling
2:Lists
3:Dictionary
4:different functions in Python
5:strings


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1) Creating lists and printing it.
2) updation & deletion from list.(using 'python' functions)
3)creating dictionary .
4)mathematical operation .(eg. total , percentage)
5)finding the maximum scorer among students.(using Max function 'python')
6)printing name of student in cetificate with high score with whitespace and strings.


### Challenges faced

 1)invalid syntax for Max function---
--> correct way is : max_scored=max(dictionary,key = dictionary.get)
                                  print(max_scored)


### Additional pointers

 :::::While doing this project we can add different functions like sum() , remove(), append(), .format(),etc.
      we can use different mathematical operators . try different methods to implement it . It is very easy.
